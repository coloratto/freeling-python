  ##### Python API for FreeLing  (experimental)  ######


  INSTALLATION

  To get a python API library, after installing FreeLing, follow the steps:

  1.- Edit Makefile in this directory to adjust the right values of
        FREELINGDIR: must be your FreeLing installation directory --e.g. /usr/local
        LIBSDIR: must be the directory where libdb_cxx and libpcre are found --e.g. /usr/local or /usr/local/mylibs
        PYTHONDIR: must be the libraries directory of your local python installation --e.g /usr/local/python2.4

   3. issue 'make' to compile the python API

   4.  Make sure that the directories contanining libdb_cxx.so and libpcre.so (LIBSDIR) are in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
       Make sure that the directory contanining libmorfo.so (FREELINGDIR/lib) is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

   5.  Test the interface with the "sample.py" script in this directory 
       (after editing it to adjust FREELINGDIR)

   USAGE

    - Write your python programms using freeling as seen in sample.py
    - Current perl API does not support tree templates, so you can not
      get a FreeLing parse tree into python... :-(
